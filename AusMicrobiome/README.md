# Australian Microbiome Initiative
The Australian Microbiome Initiative (AM) is a continental-scale, collaborative project aspiring to characterise the diversity and ecosystem service provision of the microorganisms inhabiting natural Australian ecosystems.

# The AM Consortium
The AM is an Australian wide collaboration founded on two established Bioplatforms Australia framework data initiatives: Marine Microbes and Biomes of Australian Soil Environments (BASE). The consortium involves researchers from more than 40 institutions supported by the following core partners:

    Bioplatforms Australia
    Integrated Marine Observing System
    CSIRO
    Parks Australia through Bush Blitz

Please use the following text for general acknowledgements of the initiative:

“We would like to acknowledge the contribution of the Australian Microbiome consortium in the generation of data used in this publication. The Australian Microbiome initiative is supported by funding from Bioplatforms Australia and the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) through the Australian Government’s National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS), Parks Australia through the Bush Blitz program funded by the Australian Government and BHP, and the CSIRO”.

# ASV methods

# asvBiomXchange Project
For the purposes of contributing to creating a common, central work flow for prototyping and Observatory to OBIS data flow, we've uploaded 3 example BIOM files of subsets of our asv data. These subset files are Phinch compatible BIOM files and represent one of the formats available for download via the AM's public, searchable Data Portal at: https://data.bioplatforms.com/bpa/otu/

The subset of data is timeseries data from the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) National Reference Station Maria Island (NRSMAI) in Tasmania, Australia. The files include all current metadata collected in the current format that we provide. The format is under review to work towards complying with the MIxS/MIxO standards and there will be updates soon. We've provided data for 3 amplicons, bacterial 16S v-13, archaeal 16S v1-3, and eukaryote 18S v4. Taxonomy is SILVA v132.
