Biom files created from a modified version of the banzai pipeline, see https://github.com/reikopm/mbonlive_banzai
This folder contains eDNA sample biom files for metabarcodes 12S, 16S, 18S, and COI. The biom format: biom-format.org

The Biological Observation Matrix (BIOM) 

The BIOM file format represents biological samples by observation contingency tables. BIOM is a recognized standard for the 
Earth Microbiome Project and is a Genomics Standards Consortium supported project.

The BIOM format is designed for general use in broad areas of comparative -omics, such as marker-gene surveys, in which the 
primary use is to represent operational taxonomic unit (OTU) tables: the matrix contains counts corresponding to the number 
of times each OTU is observed in each sample.

The BIOM file is an ascii text file with three sections, data (sequence reads), rows (observation metadata, taxonomic assignments), 
and cols (sample metadata, i.e. date, locations, volumes, pipeline parameters, etc)

The sample metadata definitions are still a work in progress as such the metadata tracked from each biom may be different.
